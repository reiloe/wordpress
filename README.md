### Prerequisites

- Git

- Docker Compose v2

### Quickstart

- Open a terminal

- Navigate to a folder of choice

```bash
cd my/test/folder
```

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reiloe/wordpress.git
```

- Navigate into the root folder (named wordpress)

```bash
cd wordpress
```

- Here you will find a file named example.env. Copy this file and rename it in .env.

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

> [!NOTE]
> WordPress typically starts on port 8080.  
> If you need to change this port you can do this in the .env file.
 
> [!NOTE]
> WordPress stores data in a database. This requires a database user.
> This values you will find in the .env file too.
> If you want you can change this value there.

- run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

After a short time, WordPress is ready to use.

[^1]: If you have changes the port number during setup, you must enter this port

```bash
docker compose up -e WORDPRESS_PORT=8080 -e DB_USER=MyDbUser -e DB_PASS=MyDbPass -e DB_NAME=MyWordPress
